# Calibration bot

People, among other things are famous for their inability to distinguish between things they control, know, can possibly predict and understand and things they don't.

So this bot was developed in hope it will help to better understand one's limits at least when we talk about such cognitive tasks as predicting the future.
We often make implicit assumptions about our future without properly understanding just how good our past predictions were and so to what extend we can rely on the current intution telling us for an instance that those inky clouds doesn't actually matter so much when the forecast was "clear sky and not a slightest chance of rain tomorrow".
