# Calibration bot

Many people have trouble telling the difference between what they can control, know, predict and understand, and what they can't. We often base our expectations on our past experiences, without checking how accurate they were or how much they match the current situation. For example, we might ignore the dark clouds in the sky and trust our intuition that says it won't rain, even if the weather report said otherwise.

This bot was created to help people realize their limits in these cognitive tasks, especially when it comes to forecasting the future.
